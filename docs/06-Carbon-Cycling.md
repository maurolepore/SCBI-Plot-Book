# Carbon Cycling

from core census-- all of the following, for whole forest and by size/ species, potentially in and out of deer exclosure
- biomass
    - write (or find?) code to make graph as this one in [@stovall_assessing_2018] ![*sample graph of biomass by species*](maps_and_figures/sample_biomass_graph.PNG)

- ANPP_stem (and potentially its climate sensitivity, from cores)
- woody mortality 
- downed woody debris

other data
- litter production?
- anything from NEON?
