# Biotics Drivers of Change
## Invasive Plants
(insert Caroline's information here - should include description/life history, native range, range in US, spread in pot, and data from the Shenandoah paper)

## Invasive Species and Pathogens
(expand on data found in Shenandoah paper)

## Impact of Deer and Plant Ecology
(Bill's section - include that the deer exclosure has also led to greater numbers of species)

## Interspecies Competition
(could talk about how different species fight for available space, i.e. tree fall gaps)
